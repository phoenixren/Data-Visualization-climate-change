# Self Study Project-Data Visualization of Climate Change
This is the self-study project for Data Visualization 

## Part 1- Evaluations for 5 visualizations of climate change
In the first part of this project, there are different data visualiztions of climate change to be explored and evaluated using the following framework. 
Evaluation Framework:
* **Information**
<br/>	Criterias for imformation conveyed by a good visualization: integrity, accuracy, consistency and honesty. 

* **Concept**
<br/>	A good visualization tells story that is relevent, meaningful and new.

* **Function**
<br/>	A good visualization effeciently demonstrate certain argument, is useable and fitting in a relevent context.

* **Visual From**
<br/>	How does the apperance look? Does it have a clean structure? Is there harmony in the aesthetics? 

### Visualization 1-Carbon Dioxide Emissions vs Vulnerability to Climate Change by Nation
>The Milken Institute School of Public Health created this graphic back in 2015 as a comparison between two data groups. In this visualization, the red circles represent countries which emit the most carbon dioxide.The blue circles represent the countries which are the most vulnerable due to carbon dioxide emission.  The data for this graphic was sourced from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center.
