# Self Study Project-Data Visualization of Climate Change
This is the self-study project for Data Visualization 

## Part 1- Evaluate 5 visualizations of climate change
In the first part of this project, there are 5 different data visualizations of climate change to be explored and evaluated using the following framework. 
Evaluation Framework:

* **Function**
<br/>	A good visualization should convey information that is clear and efficiently demonstrate at least one argument.

* **Concept**
<br/>	The argument demonstrated by the visualization should be relevant, meaningful and can be fit into a larger concept (e.g. climate change in this project).

* **Visual Form**
<br/>	A good visualization should have an attractive appearance with a clean structure and harmony in the aesthetics(shapes, colors, ect.)

#### Visualization 1-Carbon Dioxide Emissions vs Vulnerability to Climate Change by Nation

<br/>**Evaluation** 
<br/>The Milken Institute School of Public Health created this graphic back in 2015 as a comparison between two data groups.This visualization shows countries with the most emission of carbon dioxide and contrast with countries that are most vulnerable with climate change. The information shown in the visualization is clearly represented. The red circles represent the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by a country and blue circles represent the ND-GAIN index which is a measurement of vulnerability with climate change of a country. It clearly states an argument that countries that have the most CO<sub>2</sub> emission are different with countries which are most vulnerable with climate change and the former are mostly developed and fast-growing countries and the latter are mostly developing countries in Africa. The visualization is beautiful with its low-saturation colors and the contrast forms a large circle that is harmonic with all the small circles.  
#### Visualization 2-Global Temperature Changes from 1850-2017

<br/>**Evaluation** 
<br/>This visualization developed by Hawkins mapped global average temperature anomalies from 1850-2017. It is straightforward to use red to represent temperature that is above average and blue to represent temperature that is below average, the deeper the color, the more extreme the temperature. The graph clearly illustrates that from 1850 to 2017, the global temperature overall has been becoming high. This visualization can be used as persuasive support that the climate change is happening and the global warming is present. However, with similar argument, the graph is not as visually attractive as the warming stripes because there are too many small maps in the same graph.  
#### Visualization 3-Arctic Ice Volume Change

<br/>**Evaluation** 
<br/>This graph effectively shows the change of monthly average arctic ice volume from 1979 to 2016, with each year's volume represented by lines in different colors. The visualization directly argues that the volume of arctic ice has been shrinking since 1979. The argument is relenvant and meaningful for the concept of climate change because the melting of arctic ice can be an evidence of global warming. The structure and shape of the visualization make the difference in volume apparent to the audience and are visually clean to read.
#### Visualization 4-Land & ocean temperature records for April, 2016

<br/>**Evaluation** 
<br/>The information that the visualization intend to convey is clear enough through its title, subtitles and legends. It shows the temperature percentile of the global surface for April 2016. Red color blocks represent higher than average temperature and blue color represent below average temperature. The graph clearly argues that in April 2016, most parts of the global surface is warmer than usual. This argument is not a strong evidence of climate change through years since it only contains information at a single time point. However it is still meaningful to the context and is an example of extreme warm weather over the globe. The visualization is overall well structure and the geographical visual form is a powerful illustration for global climate data.  
#### Visualization 5-Temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> and Sunspots
![Temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> and Sunspots](images/5.jpg)
[Image Source](http://solar-center.stanford.edu/sun-on-earth/FAQ2.html)
<br/>**Evaluation** 
<br/>This plot compares the changing of global temperature, amount of CO<sub>2</sub> and sunspots observed through years. The information of the changing trend is cleared demonstrated in the graph, that all of the three has been in a increasing trend but CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature are increasing more rapidly than the sunspots in recent years. The correlation between solar energy and temperature can be argued here. This visualization explores the cause of climate change from natural force, which adds up a distinct perspective to the discussion of climate change. The visual form is effective enough in illustration although not very attractive in appearance.  
### Summary
All five visualizations picture climate change in different perspectives, and are overall effective in their arguments. The information they incorporated includes contrasting carbon dioxide emission with vulnerability to climate change among countries, factual pictures of warming temperature and extreme warm weather, the shrinking of arctic ice volume over years, and possible causes of global warming. All these topics are relevant and meaningful to the concern of climate change and how it would affect the earth and human being.
