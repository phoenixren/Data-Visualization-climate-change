# Self Study Project-Data Visualization of Climate Change
This is the self-study project for Data Visualization 

## Part 1- Evaluate 5 visualizations of climate change
In the first part of this project, there are 5 different data visualiztions of climate change to be explored and evaluated using the following framework. 
Evaluation Framework:

* **Function**
<br/>	A good visualization should convey information that is clear and effeciently demonstrate at least one argument.

* **Concept**
<br/>	The argument demonstrated by the visualization should be relevent, meaningful and can be fit into a larger concept (e.g. climate change in this project).

* **Visual Form**
<br/>	A good visualization should have an attractive appearance with a clean structure and harmony in the aesthetics(shapes, colors, ect.)

#### Visualization 1-Carbon Dioxide Emissions vs Vulnerability to Climate Change by Nation

<br/>**Evaluation** 
<br/>The Milken Institute School of Public Health created this graphic back in 2015 as a comparison between two data groups.This visualization shows countries with the most emission of carbon dioxide and cantrast with countries that are most vulnarable with climate change. The imformation shown in the visualization is clearly represented. The red circles represent the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by a country and blue circles represent the ND-GAIN index which is a measurement of vulnarability with climate change of a country. It clearly states an argument that countries that have the most CO<sub>2</sub> emission are different with countries which are most vulnarable with climate change and the former are mostly developed and fast-growing countries and the latter are mostly developing countries in Africa. The visualization is beautiful with its low-saturation colors and the contrast forms a large circle that is harmonic with all the small circles.  
#### Visualization 2-Global Temperature Changes from 1850-2017

<br/>**Evaluation** 
<br/>This visualization developed by Hawkins mapped global average temperature anomalies from 1850-2017. It is straightfoward to use red to represent temperature that is above average and blue to represent temperature that is below average, the deeper the color, the more extreme the temperature. The graph clearly illustrates that from 1850 to 2017, the global temperature overall has been becoming high. This visualization can be used as persuaive support that the climate change is happening and the global warming is present. However, with similar argument, the graph is not as visually attractive as the warming stripes because there are too many small maps in the same graph.  
#### Visualization 3-Arctic Ice Volume Change

<br/>**Evaluation** 
<br/>This graph effectively shows the change of monthly average arctic ice volume from 1979 to 2016, with each year's volume represented by lines in different colors. The visualization directly argues that the volume of arctic ice has been shrinking since 1979. The argument is relenvent and meaningful for the concept of climate change because the melting of arctic ice can be an evidence of global warming. The structure and shape of the visualiation make the difference in volume apparent to the audience and are visually clean to read.
#### Visualization 4-Land & ocean temperature records for April, 2016

<br/>**Evaluation** 
<br/>The information that the visualization intend to convey is clear enough through its title, subtitles and lengends. It shows the temperature percentile of the global surface for April 2016. Red color blocks represent higher than average temperature and blue color represent below average temperature. The graph clearly argues that in April 2016, most parts of the global surface is warmer than usual. The geographical visual form is a powerful illustration
